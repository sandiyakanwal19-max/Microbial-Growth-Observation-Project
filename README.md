# Microbial Growth Observation Project 🧫

This beginner biotechnology project studies microbial growth from air, phone, and door handle surfaces using safe, home-based methods.

---

## 🔬 Objective
To observe and compare microbial growth from different environmental sources.

---

## 🧪 Materials
- Gelatin (or agar substitute)
- Broth cube
- Sugar
- Cotton swabs
- Small plastic lids or cups

---

## ⚗️ Method
1. Prepared nutrient medium using gelatin, broth, and sugar.
2. Labeled plates for air, phone, and door handle samples.
3. Swabbed and streaked each surface.
4. Observed colony growth after 48 hours.

## 📊 Observations

| Sample | Description | Colony Color | Shape | Growth Level |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| Air | Exposed to air 5 min | White dots | Round | Moderate |
| Door Handle | Swabbed | Yellow + white | Irregular | High |
| Phone | Swabbed | Creamy | Round | Moderate |

---

## 🧠 Conclusion
Door handle samples showed the most bacterial growth due to frequent contact, showing environmental influence on microbial presence.
